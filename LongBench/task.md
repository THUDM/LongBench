> Note: In order to avoid discrepancies caused by different tokenizers, we use the word count (using Python's split function) to calculate the average length of English datasets and code datasets, and use the character count to calculate the average length of Chinese datasets.

# Task construction

> Note: For all tasks constructed from existing datasets, we use data from the validation or test set of the existing dataset (except for VCSUM).

- The tasks of [HotpotQA](https://hotpotqa.github.io/), [2WikiMultihopQA](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.580/), [MuSiQue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00573), and [DuReader](https://github.com/baidu/DuReader) are built based on the original datasets and processed to be suitable for long context evaluation. Specifically, for questions in the validation set, we select the evidence passage that contains the answer and several distracting articles. These articles together with the original question constitute the input of the tasks.
- The tasks of MultiFiedQA-zh and MultiFieldQA-en consist of long article data from about 10 sources, including Latex papers, judicial documents, government work reports, and PDF documents indexed by Google. For each long article, we invite several PhD and master students to annotate, i.e., to ask questions based on the long article and give the correct answers. To better automate evaluation, we ask the annotators to propose questions with definitive answers as much as possible.
- The tasks of [NarrativeQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07040.pdf), [Qasper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03011.pdf), [GovReport](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02112.pdf), [QMSum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05938.pdf) and [MultiNews](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1102.pdf) directly use the data provided by the original papers. In the specific construction, we use the template provided by [ZeroSCROLLS](https://www.zero.scrolls-benchmark.com/) to convert the corresponding data into pure text input.
- The [VCSUM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05280) task is built based on the original dataset, and we design a corresponding template to convert the corresponding data into pure text input.
- The [TriviaQA](https://nlp.cs.washington.edu/triviaqa/) task is constructed in the manner of [CoLT5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09752), which provides several examples of question and answering based on documents, and requires the language model to answer related questions based on new documents.
- The tasks of [SAMSum](https://aclanthology.org/D19-5409.pdf), [TREC](https://aclanthology.org/C02-1150.pdf) and [LSHT](http://tcci.ccf.org.cn/conference/2014/dldoc/evatask6.pdf) are built based on the original datasets. For each question in the validation set, we sample several data from the training set to form few-shot examples. These examples together with the questions in the validation set constitute the input for this task.
- The PassageRetrieval-en task is constructed based on English Wikipedia. For each piece of data, we randomly sample 30 paragraphs from English Wikipedia and select one for summarization (using GPT-3.5-Turbo). This task requires the model to give the original paragraph name to which the summary corresponds.
- The PassageCount task is constructed based on the English wiki. For each piece of data, we randomly sample several passages from English Wikipedia, repeat each paragraph at random several times, and finally shuffle the paragraphs. This task requires the model to determine the total number of different paragraphs in the given context.
- The PasskeyRetrieval-zh task is constructed based on [C4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683). For each piece of data, we randomly sample several Chinese paragraphs from C4 and select one of them for summarization (using GPT-3.5-Turbo). This task requires the model to give the original paragraph name to which the summary corresponds.
- For the [LCC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14893) task, we sample from the original code completion dataset. In the [RepoBench-P](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03091) task, we select the most challenging XF-F (Cross-File-First) setting from the original dataset and refer to the Oracle-Filled scenario in the paper. For each original piece of data, we randomly extract multiple cross-file code snippets, including the gold cross-file code snippet, and concatenate them as input, requiring the model to effectively use cross-file code for completion.
